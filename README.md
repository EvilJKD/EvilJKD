# Hello there! My name is José M. Cadena 👋
# You can call me Cade! 😜

I'm a computer science engineering student 💻 at Universidad San Francisco de Quito 🐉🐉

My love for computers began when I was 6 years old. I used to spend entire days using my uncle's computer.
Since then, I've been exploring technology and its features! 👀

When I was 16 when I made my first HTML page! 
Now I love programming! 😍❤️️👀
